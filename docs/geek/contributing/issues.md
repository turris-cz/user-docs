# Creating issues

If you think that our software contains a bug or if you would like to request
a new feature you can create an issue. Please follow the rules described
below to allow us to work fast and keep maximum quality.

Issues are preferably created in our [GitLab](https://gitlab.nic.cz/).

## Generic rules for creating issues

* Before you start creating an issue, please look whether someone else
hasn't created such issue before.
* Split complex problems or requests to multiple issues.
* Choose the project which is related to your issue. For example, if
you want to report a bug in the OpenVPN reForis plugin please use
[Turris / reForis / OpenVPN Plugin](https://gitlab.nic.cz/turris/reforis/reforis-openvpn).
* Try to create a self-explaining title. For example, use *Failure to add
IPv6 route on connect* and not *Bug in plugin*.
* Describe your problem precisely and thoroughly, specify everything
what would help to solve your problem or understand your suggestion.
* Be prepared to add more information on our request.
* Use meaningful sentences and simple, well understandable words.
Don't use abusive language.
