# Frequently asked questions about Turris Omnia

## Hardware

### Why 40W power source, is Omnia power hungry?

Turris Omnia comes with a 90W power source. But the real power consumption is
typically much less. With all three Wi-Fis enabled, it is typically around 6W.
But we ship our devices with power source strong enough to handle all
possible loads. And Omnia can be extended with quite some power-hungry
peripherals. Think about an Ethernet SFP module, 5G modem or NAS upgrade kit. Not
to mention all the possible devices that you can connect to the USB ports. We
choose to ship the power supply strong enough to handle all those cases and
still have some breathing space.

## LEDs are too bright, how do I tune them down?

In the default setup, you can decrease the brightness of the LEDs by pressing the
brightness button on the front of your Turris Omnia.
