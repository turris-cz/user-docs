# Frequently asked questions about Turris Omnia NG

## Hardware

### Why 90W power source, is Omnia NG power hungry?

Turris Omnia NG comes with a 90W power source. But the real power consumption is
typically much less. With all three Wi-Fis enabled, it is typically around 10W.
But we ship our devices with a power source strong enough to handle all
possible loads. And Omnia NG can be extended with quite some power-hungry
peripherals. Think about two 10Gbit Ethernet SFP modules, a 5G modem or NVMe. Not to
mention all the possible devices that you can connect to the USB ports. We
choose to ship the power supply strong enough to handle all those cases and
still have some breathing space.

### My display is broken, it keeps turning off

There is a screen saver mode enabled by default on the display. The display has a
limited lifetime. It is more than the warranty period, so we could keep it on
all the time. But we expect our devices to last much longer than our
warranty period. So we choose to turn it off when you are not using it. You
can wake it up with a press of a button.

## I'm missing two screws on each side of my Omnia NG

There are two spare holes on the sides of every Turris Omnia NG case. Those are
there intentionally. Those are meant to be used for a rack mount kit, which is
going to be sold separately.

## LEDs are too bright, how do I tune them down?

In the default setup, you can decrease the brightness of the LEDs by pressing the
button on the back of your Turris Omnia NG. Not the reset button, the other
one.
