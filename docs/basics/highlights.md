# Interesting features to try

If you are new to Turris project, there is plenty of stuff that can be done with
it. Here is a list of just of few that could be generally interesting.

## PaKon

[PaKon](apps/pakon.md) will allow you to monitor devices you have in your local
network. Running completely locally, under your control at your home monitoring
your data and not sharing those private information with anybody but you. Gives
you better overview of your network traffic and lets you verify where are other
devices uploading data and whether they are calling home.

## OpenVPN

Really easy way how to connect to your home from anywhere in the world, given
that you have public IP address. If you do, you can [setup OpenVPN
server](apps/openvpn-server/openvpn.md) in no time and easily generate configuration
for all your clients. You are just few clicks away from being able to access
your whole home network from anywhere.

## Nextcloud

If you don't trust big cloud providers you can turn your Turris into your own
personal cloud. Backup your data, synchronize calendar and contacts and share
data with your family members. All that easily and self-hosted at your home on
your Turris with the help of [Nextcloud](../geek/nextcloud/nextcloud.md).

## Community
