# Preparation of microSD card for Turris MOX

If your MOX A is connected to the internet you can insert your microSD card
into the microSD slot on the main board of module A and choose
[rescue mode number 6](rescue_modes.md) when staring the MOX. MOX will download
the image from the internet and use it.


If you don't like the previous option, you can just download the
[image](https://repo.turris.cz/hbs/medkit/) and save it to your microSD card or
any USB drive and use [rescue mode number 4](rescue_modes.md).
