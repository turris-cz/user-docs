## About

{! include-markdown './generic-mox.md' !}

This set consists of the [MOX A (Basic) module](../modules/a.md), a power
source, a microSD card and the [MOX Wi-Fi add-on
(SDIO)](../addons.md#wi-fi-sdio). It is used to provide WiFi signal or increase
its range and is suitable for purely wireless networks. You can choose between
2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi. If you want to use the faster 5GHz or 5GHz and 2.4GHz
Wi-Fi (for legacy devices) at the same time, choose the [MOX Power
Wi-Fi](powerwifi.md) set.

accessories. But there are many reasons to fall in love:
