* Automatic updates – with MOX, you are always running the latest firmware with all security patches. You don’t have to worry about anything.
* Attack identification – MOX can identify suspicious data streams and send information about them to the Turris headquarters. All you have to do is to enable this feature to improve your protection.
* Distributed adaptive firewall – the Turris headquarters automatically compares data received from thousands of routers in the network and if it identifies an attack, firewall updates are send right away to all Turris devices.
* Network storage (NAS) – each Turris MOX can be used as a shared network storage and can easily become your media server.
* Private cloud – why give your sensitive data to cloud services on the internet and pay for the privilege of doing so? Run your own cloud on MOX.
* Easy VPN – with MOX, you can set up an encrypted connection to your corporate or home network with a few clicks.
* High performance – the 1 GHz dual core processor can do everything you’d expect from it.
* Functional design – the design of the MOX with integrated antennas and without a single screw is very practical.
