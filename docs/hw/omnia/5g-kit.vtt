00:02.880 --> 00:04.880
First, we need to remove all the screws

00:40.400 --> 00:43.720
Now the second set of screws on the opposite side

01:38.360 --> 01:42.240
Let's open up the router by slightly pulling to the front

01:42.280 --> 01:45.240
and then lifting the top cover

01:50.520 --> 01:52.520
Here is the slot for SIM card

01:58.360 --> 02:06.160
In this particular model, we need to remove Wi-Fi card to access it

02:07.000 --> 02:12.960
Other revisions might have easier access to the SIM slot

02:13.800 --> 02:18.920
But lifting Wi-Fi card is enough, no need to disconnect the pigtails

02:20.680 --> 02:27.960
Now it is the time to insert the SIM card

02:29.160 --> 02:34.120
Make sure it doesn't require a PIN code beforehand ;-)

02:40.000 --> 02:43.440
SIM is now properly placed in the holder

02:43.480 --> 02:48.480
We can now return the Wi-Fi card where it belongs

02:48.880 --> 02:54.760
and put in the screws

03:17.960 --> 03:21.080
Now it's time to put in mPCIe -> M.2 adapter

03:22.880 --> 03:27.640
First we need to remove the screws that are already there

03:37.640 --> 03:42.440
Insert the adapter

03:46.080 --> 03:53.000
And also the aluminum riser

03:54.800 --> 04:03.040
And screw everything together

04:43.600 --> 04:46.600
Let's prepare the 5G card

04:46.960 --> 04:53.280
It needs to be in contact with the case because of cooling

04:53.280 --> 05:00.800
We peel of the cover of the aluminum block

05:04.120 --> 05:11.120
And glue it to the 5G card (next to M.2 connector)

05:19.120 --> 05:24.160
We insert the card into the adapter

05:24.200 --> 05:32.200
and secure it there with the plastic pin

05:33.360 --> 05:37.560
We will no longer need the old top cover

05:38.920 --> 05:40.920
Let's prepare the new one

05:41.880 --> 05:45.800
It has two extra holes

05:53.800 --> 05:59.920
We will start with the longest pigtail

06:11.720 --> 06:15.720
It goes to the right side of the cover

06:18.800 --> 06:21.840
Add the pad

06:21.880 --> 06:26.080
and the nut

06:39.960 --> 06:43.640
Now we need the second shortest pigtail

06:54.960 --> 06:59.880
And we will put it to the second hole in the top cover

07:24.040 --> 07:28.960
Now we need to remove rubber plugs from the case

07:32.320 --> 07:36.120
It might require some force ;-)

07:55.160 --> 08:02.080
Now we will insert the longer pigtail

08:09.600 --> 08:15.680
It goes to the hole further away from 5G card

08:47.240 --> 08:51.160
Notice that the holes are D shaped

09:02.880 --> 09:08.000
So is the connector on the pigtail

09:11.840 --> 09:17.960
It helps to secure it in place

09:28.960 --> 09:33.840
But it is still better to use a wrench ;-)

09:33.880 --> 09:38.160
Even for pigtails on the lower part of the case

09:42.600 --> 09:48.080
Now it is the time to connect the other ends of the pigtails to the 5G card

09:48.120 --> 09:52.800
We will start with the ones on the bottom part of the case

10:31.920 --> 10:36.760
Now the harder part - the upper cover

11:30.240 --> 11:36.320
Once secure, make sure that the case can be closed

11:40.720 --> 11:48.680
And peel of the protective cover from the aluminum block on the 5G card

11:52.320 --> 11:55.840
And let's put the case back together

11:55.880 --> 12:01.040
Start slightly to the front and carefully push it back

12:01.080 --> 12:07.120
Make sure the LEDs are aligned with the holes in the case

12:09.720 --> 12:13.640
before pushing it all the way back

12:17.760 --> 12:21.880
Now it's a time to put all the screws back

13:32.080 --> 13:35.560
Try not to loose any ;-)

14:02.760 --> 14:13.880
I said don't loose them :-)

14:28.000 --> 14:32.480
That's better ;-)

15:02.040 --> 15:06.120
The last part - 5G antennas

15:59.480 --> 16:03.320
And we are done with the hardware setup :-)
