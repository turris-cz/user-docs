# Hardware compatibility list

Turris routers are universal, powered by Linux kernel and running open
source Linux distribution. Having USB port and in some cases mPCIe port brings
multitude of possible hardware to connect to your Turris router. Sometimes it
works out of the box, sometime some quirks are needed to get it working,
sometimes you need special software and configuration to make everything work.
It is impossible for Turris team to ensure compatibility with every piece of
hardware available on the market. But what we can do is provide a place where
our users can exchange their experience. That is the goal of hardware
compatibility list.

You can find our [hardware compatibility list](https://wiki.turris.cz/doc/en/hcl)
in our wiki. For easier navigation it is divided into several subcategories:

* [LTE modems](https://wiki.turris.cz/doc/en/hcl/lte)
* [WiFi cards](https://wiki.turris.cz/doc/en/hcl/wifi)
* [USB devices](https://wiki.turris.cz/doc/en/hcl/usb)
* [mini PCIe devices](https://wiki.turris.cz/doc/en/hcl/usb)
* [Other devices](https://wiki.turris.cz/doc/en/hcl/other)

When contributing, always use the most specific category. For example for USB
LTE modem, use _LTE modems_ category and not _USB devices_. And always try to
use predefined template to make it easier for others to compare various
accessories.
